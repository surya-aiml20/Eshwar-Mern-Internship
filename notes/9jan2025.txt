REACT HOOKS :
    Earlier in IT industry , they were using class components , reason being state concept was not available with functional
    components.
    Now Hooks is used to implement states in functional components .
            Types :
                   1. useState
                   2. useEffect
                   3. useRef
                   4. useContext
                   5. useReducer


        *Best example for useState : Counter Clock, 
                                            stating the initial state as 0, we can increment , decrement , reset using the hook.
